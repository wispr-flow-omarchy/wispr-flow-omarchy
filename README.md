# Wispr Flow Omarchy

[![CI](https://github.com/omarchy-QOL/wispr-flow-omarchy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/omarchy-QOL/wispr-flow-omarchy/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This project provides build scripts to run the proprietary **Wispr Flow**
voice-dictation app natively on Linux. It repackages the Windows installer and
pairs it with a **clean-room Rust helper**, producing `.deb` packages
(Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` packages (Fedora/RHEL), and distribution-agnostic
AppImages for amd64 and arm64, plus an
[AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wispr-flow-appimage) for Arch
Linux and a Nix flake. The helper reimplements the one native capability Wispr
Flow ships only for macOS and Windows: injecting transcribed text into your
focused application.

**This is an unofficial port.** I'm not affiliated with Wispr. For the official
app and support, see [wisprflow.ai](https://wisprflow.ai). If you hit a
build-script or Linux issue,
[open an issue](https://github.com/omarchy-QOL/wispr-flow-omarchy/issues)
here.

## Installation

Prebuilt packages ship for **amd64 and arm64** with every release. Pick the
channel for your distro; the repo channels update with your normal system
upgrades. Full details — signature verification, uninstall, per-format notes —
are in [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md).

### APT (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.wispr-flow-linux.dev/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/wispr-flow.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wispr-flow.gpg arch=amd64,arm64] https://pkg.wispr-flow-linux.dev stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wispr-flow.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install wispr-flow
```

### DNF (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkg.wispr-flow-linux.dev/rpm/wispr-flow.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/wispr-flow.repo
sudo dnf install wispr-flow
```

### AUR (Arch Linux)

```bash
yay -S wispr-flow-appimage   # or: paru -S wispr-flow-appimage
wispr-flow --install-udev-rules
wispr-flow --doctor
```

The AUR package is AppImage-based, so it cannot install its input-device rule
automatically. The one-time setup above grants the active desktop session the
access needed for text injection, push-to-talk, and the shortcut recorder.

### Manual download

Grab a `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/wispr-flow-linux/wispr-flow-linux/releases).
Manual AppImage installs also need `--install-udev-rules`; the `.deb` and `.rpm`
packages install the rule automatically. See the full installation guide for
the exact command.

> [!NOTE]
> These published packages bundle the proprietary Wispr Flow app, downloaded from
> Wispr's official endpoint at build time. Wispr Flow is a trademark of its
> owners; this is an unofficial community port. Prefer to supply the installer
> yourself? [Build from source](#building) instead.

## Building

By default `build.sh` downloads the Wispr Flow installer from Wispr's official
endpoint at build time (the same source our [published releases](#installation)
use); the repo never bundles or commits it. Build a package with:

```bash
# Build an .rpm (downloads the installer automatically)
./build.sh --build rpm

# ...or point it at an installer you already have
./build.sh --build rpm --exe ~/Downloads/"Wispr Flow Setup-v1.6.7.exe"
```

`--exe` is optional: without it, `build.sh` fetches the pinned, audited
installer; with it, the build uses your local `.exe` and never fetches the
proprietary app.

Here are the common options (`./build.sh --help` lists all):

- `-b, --build <deb|rpm|appimage|nix>` — package format (default: auto-detected)
- `--arch <amd64|arm64>` — target architecture (default: host)
- `-e, --exe <path>` — installer .exe to use (default: fetch pinned version)
- `-c, --clean <yes|no>` — remove intermediate build files when done

I cover prerequisites, the Linux Electron download, the native sqlite rebuild, and
the mandatory launcher rename in [`docs/building.md`](docs/building.md).

## Configuration

I documented the environment variables, state locations, the uinput udev rule,
clipboard dependencies, the GNOME extension, and AT-SPI in
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

On Omarchy, the app starts in compact tray mode without opening the Hub. Use
**Open Wispr Flow** from its tray menu when you want the full window.

## Troubleshooting

Run `wispr-flow --doctor` first. It's the built-in diagnostic, and it checks the
display server / session, `/dev/uinput` access, clipboard tooling, the GNOME
extension, AT-SPI, push-to-talk input access, and the launcher rename. When
something breaks, I keep symptom-keyed fixes in
[`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

Build scripts and the Rust helper in this repository are released into the public

proprietary and subject to its own terms.
