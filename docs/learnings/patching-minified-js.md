# Patching minified JavaScript

Hard-won rules from maintaining a long-lived patch suite against an actively
re-minified Electron bundle. Each section names a failure mode and the fix. The
rules are upstream-agnostic; the examples and the verification recipes are
grounded in this repo's patches (`scripts/patches/*.sh`) and toolchain
(`resolve-installer-url.sh`, `7z` nupkg extraction, `.webpack/main/index.js`,
`build.sh --build …`).

Wispr Flow's main bundle is webpack output at
`.webpack/main/index.js` (renderers at `.webpack/renderer/<name>/index.js`); the
patches are Python `re` + `sed` keyed on it. See
[platform-gates.md](platform-gates.md) for re-auditing a bundle after a Wispr
version bump (and the `prettier --ignore-path /dev/null` beautify trick).

## Capturing identifiers: `\w` doesn't match `$`

JS identifiers allow `$` and `_`; minifiers freely emit names like
`$e`, `C$i`, `g$x`. The character class `\w` is `[A-Za-z0-9_]` — it
does not match `$`. A `(\w+)` against `$e` captures the suffix `e`
and returns a name that doesn't exist in the file. The failure is
silent: regex matches, downstream sed runs against a truncated name,
asar ships broken JS.

Use `[\w$]+` (repo convention; `[$\w]+` is equivalent). Strict superset of
`\w+`, so pre-`$` versions still match. Every patch in `scripts/patches/` keys
on it — e.g. `helper-resolver.sh:119` captures both the `fs` module and the
path variable out of the resolver's existence guard:

```python
r'(?P<guard>if\(!(?P<fs>[\w$]+)\(\)\.existsSync\((?P<var>[\w$]+)\)\))'
```

With `\w+` a minified `if(!$e().existsSync($t))` would capture `e`/`t` and the
rewrite would reference identifiers that aren't in the file.

## The beautified false-negative trap

Testing a regex against a beautified copy of the bundle is not verification. The
prettier-beautified text has whitespace and parens the minified bytes don't, so
a pattern can pass one and fail the other.

Shipped minified bytes:

```js
await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,g$x))
```

Beautified copy:

```js
await new Promise((n) => setTimeout(n, g$x))
```

`await new Promise\(([\w$]+)=>\s*setTimeout\(\1,\s*([\w$]+)\)\)` fails the
beautified version on the parens and the spaces around `=>`. Beautify to *read*
and locate the site (see [platform-gates.md](platform-gates.md)), but always
close the loop against the shipped minified bytes the patch actually runs on.

## Whitespace tolerance: `\s*` vs `[ \t]*`

`\s` matches newlines. A `\s*`-padded pattern is a license to span
across structural boundaries the original line layout meant to
keep apart — usually fine on minified bytes (no newlines to span),
much looser on beautified.

Use `[ \t]*` when the intent is "spaces but stay on this line."
Reserve `\s*` for crossing structural boundaries on purpose. The
`scripts/patches/` suite mixes both — `\s*` where the surrounding context is
bounded enough that newline-spanning is harmless, and literal token sequences
(`"win32"===process.platform`, `titleBarStyle:"hidden"`) where stricter
adjacency is the whole point of the anchor.

## Replacement-string escaping: `\1`, `&`, `$1`

A regex can match correctly and still produce corrupted output
because the *replacement string* has its own metacharacters. Match
debugging shows green; the asar still ships broken bytes. Three
flavors:

**sed `&`** — the entire match. `sed 's/foo/&_suffix/'` is fine
(`foo_suffix`). `sed 's/foo/literal_&_dollar/'` accidentally
interpolates the match (`literal_foo_dollar`). Escape with `\&` if
you want a literal ampersand:

```bash
sed 's/foo/literal_\&_dollar/'   # → literal_&_dollar
```

**sed `\1`** — backreferences in the replacement work as expected in BRE/ERE.
The footgun is the *pattern* side: in BRE, `$` is the end-of-line anchor, so a
literal `$` in the search pattern needs `\$`. This bites here because the suite
captures identifiers as `[\w$]+` and a minified name is routinely `$e` / `C$i`;
feed that name back into a sed pattern unescaped and the `$` reads as the
end-anchor. Escape it before interpolating:

```bash
var_re="${var//\$/\\$}"   # $e -> \$e  before use in a sed pattern
```

**JS `String.prototype.replace`: `$1`, `$&`, `$$`** — the JS
replacement DSL is its own thing. `$&` is the whole match; `$1..$9`
are capture groups; `$$` is a literal `$`. Plain `$` followed by an
unrelated char is left alone, but `$&` and `$N` get interpolated:

```js
code.replace(/foo/g, '$cost')   // → '$cost' (safe, no special)
code.replace(/foo/g, '$&_x')    // → 'foo_x' ($& = match)
code.replace(/foo/g, '$$cost')  // → '$cost' (escaped)
```

If the replacement is an injected JS snippet that happens to
contain `$1` or `$&` (template literals, regex source, a captured
`$`-name), JS will eat them. Use `$$` to escape, or build the string with
concatenation so `$` never sits next to a digit or `&`.

## Idempotency: a re-run must be byte-identical

Without it, CI re-runs and partial builds layer mutations until
something breaks visibly. The suite uses three patterns:

**Inject a marker comment, guard on it.** Every patch writes a unique
`WISPR_LINUX_*` marker into its insertion and short-circuits if it's already
there. `helper-resolver.sh:78-80`:

```bash
LINUX_MARKER="WISPR_LINUX_HELPER_BRANCH"
if grep -q "$LINUX_MARKER" "$BUNDLE"; then
  echo "Already patched ($LINUX_MARKER present in $BUNDLE) - nothing to do."
```

**Key the marker inside the widened predicate.** `linux-window-frame.sh` injects
its `WISPR_LINUX_FRAMELESS` marker *inside* the widened window-config predicate,
so the idempotency grep and the per-site match count both key on the same
insertion — a second run sees its own output and the count stays honest.

**Distinguish "already applied" from "anchor missing."** `mac-gates.sh:40-42`
checks for the darwin gate sitting immediately before the `getAppPath()` call,
and treats that as done — separate from the anchor-not-found path, so the build
log says which one happened.

## Anchor selection: prefer literals over identifiers

The above sections cover making a patch work on first run. This one
covers keeping it working release after release. A patch can apply
cleanly today and silently no-op next month.

Minified identifiers churn every release. Developer strings —
property names, log messages, IPC channel names — survive
minification untouched (true for Wispr's webpack bundle; a
`--mangle-props` build would invalidate property-name anchors).
Anchor on those. A hardcoded minified name silently no-ops the next
release; the build log still says "patched."

Two patterns from the suite:

- **Literal → derived identifier (two stages).** `helper-resolver.sh:110`
  anchors on the developer log string `"Running packaged Windows Helper
  service"`, then captures the surrounding minified logger identifier
  (`([\w$]+)\(\)\.info\(…)`) as the actual target. Stable literal locates the
  site; the dynamic capture supplies the churning name.
- **Literal-shape anchor + captured var.** `linux-window-frame.sh` pins the
  window-config site on the `"win32"===process.platform` /
  `Object.assign(<var>,{titleBarStyle:"hidden",autoHideMenuBar:!0})` literal
  shape and captures only `<var>` as `[\w$]+`. (It used to also anchor on a
  `titleBarStyle:"hiddenInset"` mac branch; 1.5.695 dropped `hiddenInset`, so
  the anchor was narrowed to the still-unique win32-predicate + hidden-assign
  pair — see the re-audit note below.)

The lesson is about finding stable points to anchor on, not about what gets
patched. Even literal anchors aren't immortal: `linux-window-frame.sh` no-oped
on Wispr 1.5.695 because the window-config *shape* itself moved — the mac branch
dropped `titleBarStyle:"hiddenInset"`, and the lone surviving three-way win32
site shifted from the Hub window (now a two-way switch whose else branch already
frames Linux) to the meeting_recorder window. The re-audit narrowed the anchor
to the win32-predicate + hidden-title-bar `Object.assign` pair (still unique).
This is why a version bump means a re-audit ([platform-gates.md](platform-gates.md)),
and why the count assertion below turns that no-op into a loud failure instead of
a silent one.

## Multi-site coordinated patches: surface partial application

Site 1 patches, site 2 misses, the asar ships half-wired. Two layers guard this.

Per patch: assert the expected match count and bail otherwise.
`linux-window-frame.sh` declares how many sites of the shape *should* exist and
refuses to widen an unknown count:

```python
if len(matches) != EXPECTED:
    sys.exit(
        f"ERROR: expected exactly {EXPECTED} frameless window-config site(s), "
        f"found {len(matches)}. Bundle layout may have changed; re-audit …")
```

For a patch applied across many files — `linux-renderer-treat-as-windows.sh`
runs over every `.webpack/renderer/*/index.js` — the driver in
`build-linux.sh` Step 3 grep-filters to the renderers that actually read
`platform?.isWindows`, so a renderer that doesn't is skipped (not failed), and
one that should match but doesn't surfaces as a missing marker.

Across the whole suite: `scripts/verify-patches.sh` static-greps the *shipped*
asar for each patch's marker, so the half-patched state fails the build even
when individual patches each logged "applied." (That gate is exactly what caught
the 1.5.695 window-frame regression: `MISSING window-frame: linux frameless
window branch`.)

## Disambiguating non-unique anchors: assert the count, narrow the region

A string anchor can appear in source maps, dead exports, or chunk-merged
duplicates alongside the live code. Picking the first match (`re.search` /
`indexOf`) may be wrong.

The suite's defense is to **assert the count and bail** rather than guess: the
`EXPECTED`-count check above fails loudly the day upstream reintroduces the
anchor shape in onboarding text or sample data far from the live site, instead
of silently patching the wrong one.

When an anchor genuinely isn't unique, narrow the search region first.
`helper-resolver.sh` scopes its rewrite to the `if(!…existsSync(…))` guard
region rather than the whole file, so duplicate sub-strings elsewhere can't be
hit.

## Verifying a hypothesis before shipping a fix

Resolve the current installer URL, download, extract without beautifying, and
test the regex against the minified bytes the patch will actually run on:

```bash
scripts/setup/resolve-installer-url.sh > resolved.txt
url=$(grep '^URL=' resolved.txt | cut -d= -f2-)
mkdir -p /tmp/verify && cd /tmp/verify
curl -fSL -o setup.exe "$url"

7z x -y setup.exe -o exe
nupkg=$(find exe -name 'WisprFlow-*-full.nupkg' | head -1)
7z x -y "$nupkg" -o nupkg
npx @electron/asar extract nupkg/lib/net45/resources/app.asar app

node -e '
  const fs = require("fs");
  const code = fs.readFileSync(
    "app/.webpack/main/index.js", "utf8");
  const re = /Object\.assign\(([\w$]+),\{titleBarStyle:"hidden",autoHideMenuBar:!0\}\)/;
  const m = code.match(re);
  console.log(m ? `MATCH: ${m[0]}` : "NO MATCH");
'
```

`NO MATCH` means the regex is wrong for the current bundle. Normal builds fetch
the exact `APP_VERSION` that the patches target and verify its repository-pinned
SHA-256. Use the resolver without `--version` only to inspect the current
upstream manifest before starting an explicit port.

## End-to-end verification (post-build)

Four layers: build log, syntactic validity, asar markers, runtime.

1. Watch the build log for partial-application warnings:

   ```bash
   ./build.sh --build appimage --clean no 2>&1 | tee build.log
   grep -E 'WARNING:|MISSING|expected exactly' build.log
   ```

   Any `WARNING:`, a `MISSING` marker, or a count-assertion `ERROR:` is a
   half-patched asar — `build-linux.sh` already hard-fails on the marker check,
   but grep the log when iterating locally.

2. `node --check` on the patched bundle — catches malformed replacements that
   serialize but don't parse:

   ```bash
   node --check build-linux/app.asar.contents/.webpack/main/index.js
   ```

3. Static-grep the shipped asar for every patch marker.
   `scripts/verify-patches.sh` automates this (its `MARKERS` array pairs a human
   label with a fixed/Perl pattern) and runs in CI on the deb build via the
   `Verify Linux patches in shipped asar` step in
   `.github/workflows/build-amd64.yml`.

4. Launch the package and check runtime state — the strongest layer. The
   headless smoke test in `tests/test-artifact-common.sh` boots the app under
   Xvfb + a private D-Bus session and polls `launcher.log` for the helper
   readiness marker:

   ```bash
   grep -F 'Helper service is ready: true' \
     "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/wispr-flow/launcher.log"
   ```

   Reaching it proves the asar loaded, the patched helper-resolver took the
   Linux branch, the renamed Electron binary set `isPackaged=true` (migrations
   ran), and the helper IPC handshake completed — far more than a structure
   check.
